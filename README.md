oAuth2 server using Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant
-------------------------------------------------------------

This grant type is used where the client is trusted by the resource owner.
eg. a native ios app where the resource owner is the user and the client was created by the service owner.

This demo just uses memory for the token and credential storage.

Based on the examples at:
https://github.com/thomseddon/node-oauth2-server/

but uses JWT tokens instead of the default implementation.
